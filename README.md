# Welcome to Jumpman-Hangman. 

Thank you for taking the time to check out my project. It is a Michael Jordan-themed version of the popular game, Hangman. The technologies that I used for tis are as follows: 

* HTML
* CSS 
* JavaScript
* Photoshop for editing photos
* dafont.com for generating custom font
* Font Squirrel for uploading my custom font via webkit
* Keepvid.id to download videos from youtube and convert into MP4
* favicon.i0 to create custom favicon
